Place your .auto files here (created in PathPlanner desktop app).
Required auto names referenced in RobotContainer.java:
  - FourNoteClimbAuto.auto
  - TwoNoteAuto.auto
  - TaxiOnly.auto

You can add more and register them in RobotContainer.configureAutoChooser().

Dashboard labels use neutral names ("Four Piece Climb Auto", "Two Piece Auto")
while these file names remain for backward compatibility.
