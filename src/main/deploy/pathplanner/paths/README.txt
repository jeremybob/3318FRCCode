Place your .path files here (created in PathPlanner desktop app).
These are referenced by your .auto files automatically.

Current paths for 2026 REBUILT:
  - DriveToHub.path    : Start position → Blue HUB (shoot preloaded FUEL)
  - HubToDepot.path    : Blue HUB → Blue Depot (collect more FUEL)
  - DepotToHub.path    : Blue Depot → Blue HUB (second scoring cycle)
  - TaxiForward.path   : Simple drive forward from start

NOTE: These paths are drawn for Blue alliance. PathPlanner will automatically
mirror them for Red alliance at runtime (see RobotContainer.configurePathPlanner).

Customize these in the PathPlanner desktop app to match your team's
preferred starting position and field paths. The waypoint coordinates
above are starting points — tune them on your practice field.
